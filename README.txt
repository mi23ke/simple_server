This java application uses the com.sun.net.httpserver package to write a
simple server application. The program creates a server that is bound to the
localhost. Once the application is running, the user can open a browser and go
to the following URL to see the results.
http://127.0.0.1:2323/project1
Doing so will display a message and an image. The console also prints data
pertaining to the requests and responses used by the server.
